# N-Body-Simulation
- NBody.cpp drives the program, the executable name is NBody
- Applied widely-used methods in cosmology, semiconductors, and fluid dynamics to simulate the motion of n celestial planets in the solar system. 
- Ensured precise simulation with considerations of gravitational, net forces and pertinent determinants.
- The planets can move based off of the distance between different planets, gravity force, net force, acceleration, and velocity.
- Additionally, printed out the elapsed time on the console, and play a sound file.
